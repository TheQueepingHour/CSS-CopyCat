          <h2>What's a cephalopod?</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">
            A cephalopod is an animal belonging to the group Cephalopoda,
            containing octopus, squid, cuttlefish, nautilus, and kin. The word
            "cephalopod" is derived from Greek and means "head foot," which
            perfectly describes animals that have eyes just above their many
            limbs. These boneless creatures can be found exclusively in marine
            habitats, making them the ideal inspiration for ocean lore around
            the world. Cepahlopods have fascinated generations of people with
            their elusive nature and captivating appearance - enticing us ever
            closer to explore the secrets of the oceans depths.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="anatomySec">
        <div>
          <h2>Cephalopod anatomy - head over arms with a donut-shaped brain</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">If you were to rebuild yourself as an octopus, you'd take your torso, stick it atop your
            head, and then arrange your limbs around your face. Perhaps not the most flattering look for a humna, but it
            works perfectly for an octopus.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Mantle</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The bag-like sac that sits above a cephalopod’s eyes doesn’t contain the brain. It’s
            called the mantle and it holds the animal's internal organs, including its three (!) hearts, gills,
            reproductive organs, ink sac, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Donut brain</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The brain is located behind the eyes and is shaped like a donut, wrapped around the
            esophagus. That may be hard to wrap your brain around, but a cephalopod brain is indeed shaped like a ring,
            and when the animal consumes food, the brain is slightly stretched as food moves through the esophagus. You
            could say that octopus, squid, and cuttlefish always have food on the brain.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Limbs</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Typically, arms, tentacles, or a combination of the two will extend from the
            cephalopod’s head. The arms are distinct from tentacles in that they’re completely lined with suction cups.
            Tentacles, on the other hand (or arm?), sometimes terminate in rounded clubs with suction cups and sometimes
            with hooks. Cephalopods use tentacles to grab passing prey.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mb-5"><strong>So which cephalopods have which kinds of limbs? </strong>An octopus has
            eight arms and no tentacles. A squid or cuttlefish will have eight arms and two tentacles. A nautilus, being
            very unique, has many sticky tentacles, but no arms.</strong></p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="mt-5">
          <h3>Beak</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mb-5">At the center of all these limbs is a bird-like beak used for piercing and
            consuming food. It features a tongue-like belt of teeth called the radula. The radula is used to rasp food
            items and break them into smaller pieces — very helpful when your food passes right through the center of
            your brain.</p>

      <section id="disguiseSec">
        <div>
          <h2>Masters of disguise</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mb-4">The skin of an octopus, squid, or cuttlefish seems almost to pulse with color and
            light. It appears electric as colors and patterns dance across it. In truth, these animals can create unique
            displays or disappear entirely thanks to the presence of chromatophores. Chromatophores are tiny sacs of
            pigment that can expand and contract in response to a series of environmental cues. It has been observed
            that cephalopods don’t willfully control their color-changing ability. Instead, the skin itself acts almost
            like an eye, taking in cues that elicit a colorful response. Cephalopods are believed to be colorblind,
            which makes their ability to vanish into the background even more fascinating.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg mb-4">The ability to change colors for camouflage is crucial for protection from
            predation. If you were an invertebrate, an animal without a backbone, you’d want to make your soft, squishy,
            tasty body could disappear from the eyes of hungry predators. Chromatophores are responsible both for
            disguise and for a showy display. Why would you want to advertise your presence? When mates or rivals are
            around, flashing dazzling displays of warning or romance are particularly useful.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Whether for display or camouflage, the ability to rapidly change color is another
            captivating feature of many cephalopods.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/images/chromatophores.png" alt="Chromatophores png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <div class="mt-5">
          <h4>Not all cephalopods camouflage</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Camouflage is not the only way cephalopods deflect predators. The nautilus, for example,
            has no chromatophores and relies on a hard shell for protection. In the depths of the sea, the vampire squid
            performs a defensive “pineapple pose” and hides itself within its webbed arms.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="shellSec" class="mt-5">
        <div>
          <h2>A shell of a family tree</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The phylum Mollusca to which cephalopods belong is filled with creatures that have
            distinct and lovely shells, from your average garden snail to the iridescent abalone. Yes, cephalopods are
            related to chitons, clams, mussels, and other shelled critters! But not all mollusks have shells. Over time,
            many cephalopods evolved to lose or reduce their shells, replacing them with other defense mechanisms. These
            adaptations allow them to quickly change color, jet-propel themselves away from danger, or disappear in a
            cloud of ink. Cuttlefish have a hard internal shell-like structure called a cuttlebone and squid have a more
            flexible internal structure called a pen, both of which are used for internal support. Octopuses have no
            shell-like structure at all. Being without a shell has its advantages, though, when you are squeezing
            yourself into an inaccessible crevice to escape a predator.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg fw-bold">While cephalopods may look nothing like their shelled relatives, they do share
            several features in common:</p>
          <ul class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-start" id="commonsList">
            <li class="fs-5 my-2">All mollusks have a <strong>mantle</strong>, which encloses the internal organs and
              produces the shell.</li>
            <li class="fs-5 my-2">The <strong>radula</strong>, the rasping tongue that scrapes food into smaller pieces,
              can be found inside a cephalopod's beak and in the mouths of snails and other snail relatives.</li>
            <li class="fs-5 my-2">Whether for digging down into the sand and disappearing like a clam or slowly creeping
              along the surface like a snail, all mollusks have a <strong>foot</strong>. A cephalopods "foot" is
              modified into arms and tentacles.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="sensesSec" class="mt-5">
        <div>
          <h2>Senses</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Cephalopods use their suction cups to grab onto prey. The suction cups are also key to
            helping them explore their world because they're responsible for the senses of taste and smell. Imagine how
            different our world would be if we tasted everything our hands touched! An octopus relies on its tactile
            smelling and tasting ability to explore the environment and seek out prey.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="dietSec" class="mt-5">
        <div>
          <h2>Diet and feeding strategies</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The feeding styles and diets of cephalopods are as varied as their lifestyles. Predators
            will actively hunt fish, crustaceans, and sometimes other cephalopods, but this isn’t the only way to find
            food. Some are scavengers and even detritivores (that consume dead organic material).</p>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">A squid uses its tentacles to snatch a passing fish. A cuttlefish creeping along
            carefully on two of its arms would potentially whip out its tentacles to catch a shrimp it had hypnotized
            with a flashing display of chromatophores. An octopus could plunge an arm into a crevice, taste a crab with
            its suction cups, and extract the delicious crustacean for dinner. A nautilus on the other hand can use its
            sticky tentacles to scavenge a dead fish, and a vampire squid uses a long sticky filament to catch marine
            snow (organic material drifting down from the surface).</p>

          <h2>Living legends</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Cephalopods with all their amazing adaptations ruled the seas as top predators for
            millions of years before the arrival of bony fishes. The earliest cephalopod fossil dates back 515 million
            years!!</p>
